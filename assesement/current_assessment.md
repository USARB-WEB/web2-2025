1. Project ToR With database schema
You must create a project ToR (Terms of Reference) document that includes a database schema for you project. The ToR should outline the project's objectives, requirements, and the structure of the database you plan to use. This document will serve as a guide for your development process and help ensure that all necessary components are considered from the outset.
The Database must be created using https://dbdiagram.io/
3. NestJS Linked CRUD modules without database(Study groups, Students)
You must create a NestJS(other language or framework can be used) project that includes linked CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) modules for managing study groups and students. The project should be structured to allow for easy expansion and maintenance, following best practices for code organization and modularity. The CRUD operations should be fully functional, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete records for both study groups and students.
3. NestJS Linked CRUD modules WITH database(Study groups, Students)
You must create a NestJS(other language or framework can be used) project that includes linked CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) modules for managing study groups and students, with a database integration. The project should be structured to allow for easy expansion and maintenance, following best practices for code organization and modularity. The CRUD operations should be fully functional, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete records for both study groups and students. The database schema should be designed to effectively represent the relationships between study groups and students.
4. Intermediate project status 1
You will provide an intermediate status update on your project, detailing the progress made so far, any challenges encountered, and the next steps planned. This update should include a summary of completed tasks, ongoing work, and any adjustments to the original project plan. The goal is to ensure that the project is on track and to identify any areas that may require additional attention or resources.
5. Practical assessment Nr. 1 - CRUD
Practical assessment will be about creating 2 linked CRUD modules with database. Nest JS or other backend framework can be used.
5. Practical assessment Nr. 2 - Custom features
Here you will implement some custom features to your existing project with database. You can use Nest JS or other backend framework. Examples:
- user authentication
- endpoint to display grouped data about sales by month
- endpoint to display aggregated data about sales by product
- product ordering endpoint
- etc.
7. Pre-final project status 2
You will provide a pre-final status update on your project, detailing the progress made since the last update, any challenges encountered, and the next steps planned. This update should include a summary of completed tasks, ongoing work, and any adjustments to the original project plan. The goal is to ensure that the project is on track for completion and to identify any areas that may require additional attention or resources.
